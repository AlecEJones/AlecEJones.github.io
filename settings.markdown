## In-Game Settings

You can toggle specific game settings in game to your liking. For the game owner, they are able to switch between Live and Play-by-email (PBEM).

The only practical difference between the two settings is the ability to receive emails when it is your turn.

The map scrollbar allows you to toggle between a fixed map (where you have to scroll the entire page) and a map inside a scrollable window.

If you are playing with a bunch of randoms, you can replace their names with the houses they represent. That makes it more thematic and easier to deal with in chat.
