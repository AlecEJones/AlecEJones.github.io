## Creating a Game

But you'll need to be logged in first.

## Game type options

SNR supports regular base-game play as well as a number of variants and expansion scenarios, including all the official FFG expansions (or will eventually).

Base game - 10 rounds, factions in home territories.

Race to King's Landing - Same as base game, but Baratheon is excluded as a faction and some areas of the map are blocked off.

## Passwords

Add a password to block randoms from joining your game.

## Use ADwD / AFFC cards

The game has an additional set of cards for every house, including the Arryn and Targaryen factions. Try them out if the base game is getting a little old.

## Random Houses
You are allowed to pre-select houses, or set houses to random. 

## Random Chosen Houses
You can additionally randomize only player-selected houses, so that any house that is un-chosen will be designated as a vassal (because some houses work better as vassals than others).

## Tides of Battle

This optional variant adds some randomness to battles by adding a 24-card deck. One card is issued to each player in a battle, adding additional strength 0-3, a sword, a fort, or a skull (automatic casualty). Good if you prefer your battles not to be completely deterministic and want battles to be more like the unexpected risks of a real-life military campaign.

## Clash of Kings Variant

This variant from the first edition of the game lets everyone know all cards in the Westeros phase from the next 3 rounds. If you fancy yourself a long-term strategist and dislike the randomness of the Westeros draw, try this one out.

## Sea Order Tokens

Sea order tokens were added in the Mother of Dragons expansion and do not require playing with MOD to be used. The benefit they give is that they make your order token choices a little larger, which is nice. You have an additional support order, a -1 move that is ship-exclusive, and an Iron Bank token, which will be usable IF and only if the Iron Bank module is added (not currently available).

## Draft Mode

If you are familiar with the game and want some additional craziness, try draft mode. You and other players will be able to draft from the entire pool of available house cards. Keep in mind that you are still only permitted 7 to a hand, and that includes the standard 0-1-1-2-2-3-4 hand structure.

## Thematic Draft Mode

Same deal as draft mode, but the pool of selectable cards is limited to whatever variant you are playing (base game, ADwD, or MOD).

## Endless Mode

Instead of 10 rounds, go until players collectively decide to end the game at the end of a designated round. You can choose when that end is at any time.
