## Translations to other languages

Swords and Ravens does not support native localization at the moment.
But please note that there are countless browser addons for all sorts of browsers that provide acceptable results with the help of Google Translate.
Download any addon, set the source language to English and your desired target language for https://play.swordsandravens.net and all texts will be automatically translated.
This has been tested in Firefox and Chrome Desktop and has been approved. Surely there are similar solutions for mobile devices as well.
