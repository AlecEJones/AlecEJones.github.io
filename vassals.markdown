## Vassal Setup (Player-controlled neutral houses)

---
Vassal setups are approximated according to MOD rules, except in the DwD scenario, where they have been approximated by Gereon, site maintainer.


Each round, one or more vassals may be selectable for control by players. Vassals can be chosen in Iron Throne track order, and each player may only be allowed to control one.


Players may wish to skip control of a vassal in a specific round. This is often because they want to attack the vassal itself and take its territory.


You cannot attack your own vassal.
