## Hidden Features
Don't miss some of the other, more obscure features of the platform.

## Westeros Phase tooltips

You can hover over the Westeros Phase with your mouse to see the remaining Westeros cards. Now you can estimate the chances that that badly needed Mustering card will come up next round.

## Gifting Power Tokens

You can hover over a player's power token image to pull up a menu for gifting tokens.

When you can't win, bribe your way to victory!

## Getting Territory Information

Likewise, hover over a territory to get more information about it.

## Houses are Re-ordered by Score

Houses will be reordered first based on the number of castles they control, and secondly by number of overall territories controlled. Players with 5 castles are shown in orange, and 6 are shown in red (and about to win, watch out!).
