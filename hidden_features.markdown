## Hidden Features
Don't miss some of the other, more obscure features of the platform.

## Westeros Phase tooltip

You can click **Westeros phase** with your mouse to browse the remaining Westeros cards. Now you can estimate the chances that that badly needed Mustering card will come up next round.

## Wildling tooltip

You can click on the Mammoth icon with your mouse to browse the Wildling deck. If you have seen the top card, you can see it again here until it is pushed to the bottom of the deck.

When you can't win, bribe your way to victory!

## Getting Territory Information

Likewise, hover over a territory to get more information about it.

## Houses are Re-ordered by Score

Houses will be reordered first based on the number of castles they control, and secondly by number of overall territories controlled (visualized as tooltip when hovering over the castle icon). Players with 5 castles are shown in orange, and 6 are shown in red (and about to win, watch out!).
