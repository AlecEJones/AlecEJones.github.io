## Current Beta Progress

S&R has recently released the first publicly playable Mother of Dragons 8 player variant with House Targaryen. Now everyone can create an 8-player game to unlock Essos and test the new Targaryen dynamics such as dragons, new victory conditions or adjusting the Clash of Kings bids. If you find any bugs or crashes in your game, please report them immediately through the usual channels.
